The data was collected in between November 2014 to May 2015 by a group of Danish researchers. It is a very big dataset with around 59,000 rows of data. This was too much to work with so I did some major trimming of the dataset. The essay-type questions were split up into nine different categories, so I removed rows that had any unfilled essays in any of the nine categories and combined them all into a full essay category. For the religion column, I just wanted the userâ€™s religion and not how they felt about it, so I split it in a way that only gives the religion. ")

None of the participants had a say in whether or not they wanted their personal data to be released to the public. The researchers argued that since the data was already publicly available, they had the right to use it for their research. Originally, the dataset had usernames that could be traced back to people if they had used the same username on another site, but that has since been removed. ")
